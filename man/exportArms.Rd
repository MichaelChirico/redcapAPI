\details{
From the REDCap API Documentation:

This function allows you to export the Arms for a project

NOTE: this only works for longitudinal projects.

It is not sufficient to make the project a longitudinal project. The
project must satisfy one of two conditions: 1) have at least two arms and
one event defined; or 2) have one arm and at least two events defined. If
neither of these conditions are satisfied, the API will return a message
such as \code{ERROR: You cannot export arms for classic projects}, an
error message that isn't as descriptive of the nature of the problem as
we might like.

This package was developed under REDCap Version 5.8.2.  My institution is usually a little behind on updating REDCap and so some features of the API may not always be available.

The redcapDbConnection methods are underdeveloped as I don't personally have access to the REDCap database (and so am unable to test features).  If you have that kind of access, feel free to develop the redcapDbConnection methods.

Changes in Version 1.1 (2014-10-01)
  * redcapAPI requires Hmisc 3.14-6 or higher.  This is a consequence of 
    the following item.  Please update your Hmisc package.
  * The Hmisc package was moved from the Suggests field to the Imports 
    field.  This reflects the addition of some of the label functions in 
    Hmisc being explicitly exported, making them available to import.

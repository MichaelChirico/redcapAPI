Changes in Version 1.1 (2014-10-01)
  * redcapAPI requires Hmisc 3.14-6 or higher.  This is a consequence of the following item.  Please update your
    Hmisc package.
  * The Hmisc package was moved from the Suggests field to the Imports field.  This reflects the addition of some of
    the label functions in Hmisc being explicitly exported, making them available to import.  
  * Bug fix: in `importRecords` meta data was not previously exported when a project info 
    object was not provided.  This is now corrected
  * added function `apiCall`.  This wraps a call to `tryCatch`.  If a Gnu/TLS recv error is returned, the encoding is
    changed from 'gzip' to 'identity' to successfully retrieve the API response.
  * `tryCatch` calls are added to `redcapProjectInfo` to prevent fatal errors when one of the API functions casts an 
    error.  The output is modified to indicate where the problem occurred.  This is most likely to affect `exportUsers`.
    An unresolved issue behind this is logged in the issues on Github.
